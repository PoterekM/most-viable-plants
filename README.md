# Most Viable Plants
#### _Epicodus Capstone Project October 5th, 2017_
_**By Michelle Poterek**_

## Description
This is an application to make the gardening season seamless. This application will alert the user if the high is going to be above 90 so they can water the plants accordingly, or if the weather is going to be below 35 so they can cover them.

## Installation
You can visit the application through this link:

OR:
In Terminal,
* `git clone https://github.com/PoterekM/most-viable-plants.git`
* `cd most-viable-plants`
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`
* In your browser,
  * Visit the app at http://localhost:8080.

## User Story
* A user should be able to go to the website and see the high and low for today and tomorrow with symbols on page according to temperature.
* A user should be able to fill out a form and save the information to firebase.


### Wishlist
* A user should be able to click a button to adjust the last time the plant has been watered.
* A user should be able to hit a button if it rains so all of the plants share a "last watered" date.
* Data is persistent in Firebase.
* A user can search through an API for best planting practice.
* A user can visually see their history of watering.
* A user can add more actions: planting, adding compost, harvesting.
* A user can get a calendar notification.

## To Do list
* Clean up response from API and remove decimal points.

## Development Planning
* Build application as presentational components initially.
* Display API information for my profile to the user.
* Create Jest Tests.
  * Check in and see how the user story is running and ensure proper user-flow.
* Style Application.
